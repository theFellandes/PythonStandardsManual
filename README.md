Python Standards Manifesto
======================
This documentation is a documentation about Python coding standards.  

The main goal of this manifesto is being a summarization of PEP 8, PEP 256, PEP 257, Google's Python Style Guide and other Python coding standards. 

Remember: 4 spaces, not 1 tab.

Each topic in the Table of Contents has its own directory with a README.md file. 

The contents of this manifesto isn't final and will be updated as I learn more about Python coding standards.

1) [Naming Conventions](1_NamingConventions/README.md)
2) [Docstrings and Commenting](2_DocstringsAndCommenting/README.md)
