Python Standards Manifesto

Unit Testing Format
=====================

This chapter is about docstrings and commenting in Python.

Docstrings should be frequently used in a class and at the start of 
the function since this allows a documentation to developer. 
This topic is controversial by nature since there are lots of opinion surrounding this topic. 
I think a short summary of a function in a docstring should be used regardless of how expressive the function may be.
